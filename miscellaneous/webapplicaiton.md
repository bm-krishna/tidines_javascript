webapplication:

   1. A web application is application software that runs on a web server, unlike computer-based software programs that are run locally on the operating system of the device. 
   2. Web applications are accessed by the user through a web browser.
   3. Web applications use a combination of server-side logics(java, javascript) to handle the storage(db) and retrieval of the information, and client-side scripts (JavaScript and HTML) to present information to users.

The web application requires a web server to manage requests from the client, an application server to perform the tasks requested, and, sometimes, a database to store the information.

Here's what a typical web application flow looks like:

   1. User triggers a request to the web server over the Internet, either through a web browser or the application’s user interface.
   2. Web server forwards this request to the appropriate web application server
   3. Web application server performs the requested task – such as querying the database or  processing the data – then generates the results of the requested data
   4. Web application server sends results to the web server with the requested information or  processed data
   5. Web server responds back to the client with the requested information that then appears on   the user’s display.
